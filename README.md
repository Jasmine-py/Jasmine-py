## Hi there, I'm Jasmine 👋🏾

- 👔   I'm a research student interested in Machine Learning applied to big data analysis in Cancer Genomics.
- 🎒   I graduated my undergraduate career in Cell and Molecular Biology (B.S.), and Biochemistry, (B.S.), both at San Francisco State University (SFSU). I returned to school to earn my Master's in Science degree, Cell and Molecular Biology, also at SFSU. During my Master's, I took a coding class in Bioinformatics in R, as well as a coding class in Data Analysis for Scientists in Python, while in a research lab studing yeast organelle size regulation applying MATlab programming algorithms. Since then, I have taken several online courses to strengthen my coding focusing on Python, terminal and R.
